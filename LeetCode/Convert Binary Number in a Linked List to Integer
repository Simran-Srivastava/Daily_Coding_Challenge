'''
Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.
Example 1:

Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
Example 2:

Input: head = [0]
Output: 0
