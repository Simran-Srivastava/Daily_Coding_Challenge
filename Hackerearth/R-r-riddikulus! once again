'''
"R-r-riddikulus"  used in the movie Harry Potter to transform anything from one form to other, Similarly you have to transform the array by rotation.

A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2  left rotations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].

Given an array a of n integers and a number, d, perform d left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

 

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and d, the size of a and the number of left rotations you must perform. 
The second line contains space-separated integers a[i] .

Constraints

Output Format

Print a single line of n space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing  left rotations.

SAMPLE INPUT 
5 4
1 2 3 4 5
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
5 1 2 3 4'''
